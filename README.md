# Findify

# Introduction

Findify is a Spotify web app that generates recommendations based on the frequency of genres that appear on a user's playlist. 

# Technologies

* Express.js
* Jade

# Features

Findify requires a OAuth 2.0 login, which generates a token that allows users to request data from Spotify API endpoints. In this app, the user will be prompted to select a playlist, which will then proceed to generate songs with genres proportional to the distribution of song genres in the original playlist. Users will have an option to preview the song and choose whether or not they wish to add the song to their playlist.

The app itself is very user intuitive, as it adopts a "tinder-style" approach to accepting or declining song recommendations. The user need only click the green check to accept a song, thereby adding it to their playlist, or decline the song.

# To-do

* Include embeds for interactive song previews
* Format the app to be more visually appealing
